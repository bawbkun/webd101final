	<p>Currently I am operating 2 Raspberry Pi single board computers that run a few different systems. One is a forward facing machine that is seperated from my other machines and the other 
	runs my 3D printer. This page will mainly deal with the Raspberry Pi that runs my forward facing systems, all of my exposed services run on this machine for isolation.

	<dd>The main operating system for this machine that runs all of my forward facing applications. These are all also containerized with docker as it makes for easy deployment of multiple things. This is also where this page will be hosted once made live.</dd>

	<dd>Put these both together as you know by now this is my favorite method to deploy programs and multiple copies of those programs.</dd>

	<dd>Any time my IP address changes this updates my cloudfare account with my new IP and helps me use proxied hosts to not expose my network.</dd>

	<dd>I run 2 different Wordpress sites currently that have not been setup. Their uptime has proved to be stable and I just need to acutally work on them.</dd>
