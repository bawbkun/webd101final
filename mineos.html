	<p>A virtual machine that is currently hosting 1 of 3 planned Mincraft servers. This will most likely change a lot and never fully host all 3 servers but it should be possible with this configuration. 
	Currently it runs a main operating system of Ubuntu server with docker installed. Ubuntu will run the main server and docker will host the Java version. This project is only in the first server phase and has crashed which means
	I either start again or try to resolve the issue.</p>
